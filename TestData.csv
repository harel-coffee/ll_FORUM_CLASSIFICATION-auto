"Yes, linear regression assumes normality of residuals.  It does not matter if the outcome variables are normally distributed or not.

The distribution of x values does not matter at all (provided that you have a lack of highly influential outliers).

If, for example we have 10 diferent variables, and we want to choose few most influenced and make linear regression model, could we at beginning look at the correlation between variables and observed outcome, and correlation between variables its self. Those variables that are higly correlated with outcome and have low correlation with others variables, will certainly be in the model. Others that are correlated with outcome, but also correlated with other variables (colinear), will be chosen by the beta coefficients. Just like et the end of video politics and Obama.

"OK, now I watched it and I'd have to say, that had a bit of \hand waving\"" involved. I think it had a little too much. Unless you have an argument as to why you can actually ignore $alpha$ when looking for $eta$ that was over simplified. I have a hunch that if she continued with her method, and she did say you would have \""to do the same\"" for $alpha$, it would actually be solved as if those derivatives were partial derivatives. In other words, she will still need to solve the equations simultaneously as $alpha$ does not just disappear from her first equation.Here's the correct explicit routine.The sum of the squared residuals, I'm calling it $e^2(alpha , eta)$ is$e^2(alpha,eta) =  displaystyle sum_{i=1}^n ( y_i - (eta x_i + alpha))^2 = sum_{i=1}^n ( y_i - eta x_i - alpha)^2$Now, take the partial derivative with respect to $alpha$ (remember, everything is a constant, as if it is just a number, except $alpha$) to get$frac{displaystyle partial}{displaystyle partial alpha} e^2(alpha , eta) = displaystyle sum_{i=1}^n 2 (y_i - eta x_i - alpha) (-1)$$ hspace{1.4in} = displaystyle sum_{i=1}^n 2 ( alpha + eta x_i - y_i)$(we used the Chain Rule and I rearranged) and now the partial with respect to $eta$$frac{displaystyle partial}{displaystyle partial eta} e^2(alpha , eta) = displaystyle sum_{1=1}^n 2 (y_i - eta x_i - alpha) (-x_i)$$ hspace{1.4in} = displaystyle sum_{i=1}^n 2 ( alpha x_i + eta x_i^2 - y_i x_i)$Next, we set both partials equal to 0. This gives$displaystyle sum_{i=1}^n 2 ( alpha + eta x_i - y_i) = 0$$displaystyle sum_{1=1}^n 2 ( alpha x_i + eta x_i^2 - y_i x_i) = 0$Now, I'm going to divide both equations by 2 and break up the sums in each to get$displaystyle n alpha + eta sum_{i=1}^n x_i - sum_{i=1}^n y_i = 0$$displaystyle alpha sum_{1=1}^n x_i + eta sum_{1=1}^n x_i^2 - sum_{1=1}^n y_i x_i = 0$If I divide the first equation by $n$ and recall that $ar{x} = frac{displaystyle sum x_i}{displaystyle n},,$ and $,,ar{y} = frac{displaystyle sum y_i}{displaystyle n}$We get (for the first equation) that for an extreme value (in our case we want a minimum) we must have$alpha + eta ar{x} - ar{y} = 0$or, rearranging a bit$alpha = ar{y} - eta ar{x}$.That's one of our equations. Now use that equation to replace $alpha$ in the second equation, and rearrange a bunch in order to solve for $eta$, I get$eta = frac{displaystyle sum x_i , y_i - ar{y} sum x_i}{displaystyle sum x_i^2 - ar{x} sum x_i}$If """,0,51,495,63.94,25.89,28.41,32.72,70.71,13.13,55.35,39.39,16.57,13.33,10.3,1.41,0.61,1.01,0,3.23,4.44,8.28,5.05,2.83,4.04,0.2,9.49,1.62,1.21,0.4,9.9,1.62,1.21,0.81,0.4,0,0.2,0,4.44,0,0,1.01,0,6.46,1.82,1.21,2.02,1.21,0.81,2.42,5.05,4.44,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,4.85,1.41,1.21,1.21,1.01,0,1.82,7.47,0.4,6.06,0.4,2.42,2.83,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,0.2,0,0,65.66,1.82,4.85,0,0,0,0,3.84,0.81,1.01,7.68,45.66

Because this is one of those subjects, which I feel is worthless to know little about, only knowing it well, makes it worth knowing at all. Another poor statistican is not what we need in this world.I suggest extending the length of this course slightly and adding more real life <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>oblems for <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>acticing the knowledge learned in each module (extra R exercises would rock too).

"I agree with the first post. It's not a question of following some procedure correctly. They are slow to navigate, it's hard to narrow the focus, and hard to browse. The threads are typically only a few posts long. Yes, there are nice aspects such as the link at the bottom of the lecture. But, I think, the difficulty of use leads to less activity.The courses on edx in general, seem to be very nicely constructed in terms of lectures, quizzes, HW, etc. I really like that and I appreciate the structure. But the forums are not great. There are times when I miss edx when I'm using Coursera, but the forums on Coursera are really easy to use and browse and they have an enourmous amount of activity. I think they are much better. If I post on several threads in one course I will get possibly dozens and dozens of email notifications with the post for the threads I've posted on. Sometimes it's annoying but uitimately they work better.

"I think it is also the case that you always (sort of) assume that there may be meaningful confounders in any analysis of a possible relationship between variables in biological or medical studies. It is typically a question of degree of confounding and likelihood of a particular confounder and what ability you have to detect confounders. Sometimes what turns out to be a confounder is not particularly intuitive, at least a priori, but is detected due to accident or unusual insight. She shows an example of just letting the software search your data. That method in particular, is not utilizing anything but the most peripheral insight; you gathered data on more than one variables. I suspect that currently, with the ubiquity of belief that through the essentially brute force use of data and the use of statistical tools on that data, that trust in methods such as she described, is growing.

"One way to consolidate threads is to have categories for posting and reading. It definitely does not eliminate the problem of multiple threads but it helps enormously. In a Finance course on Coursera that I took, they had an \Assignments\"" category among several other basic super-categories. When you selected \""Assignments\"" you were now faced with a category for each week's assignment, \""Assignment 1\"" , \""Assignment 2\"" , and so on. When you selected the Assignment you were interested in, you then had two choices: \""Questions 1 - 5\"" and \""Questions 6 - 10\"". When one of those was selected, you found yourself in the belly of the beast. There was typically one or two threads for each question (there were two versions of each question in the assignment), and then many posts per thread as we approached the due date.I don't know if that sounded too much like telephone answering system menus, but it isn't and wasn't. You could very quickly (the server and content worked and loaded quickly) get where you wanted, either to post or read. If you did not uncheck the \""subscribe\"" check box when you posted on a thread (I always subscribed, at least initially) you recieved an email with the content of any post in that thread, with a link that took you to the post.I spent way too much time reading and responding to posts due to the ease of use and the lack of tedious waiting (as I experience on the edx forums).

"I understand that we should compare the results for the adjusted and unadjusted $eta$ for a particular variable, in order to assess the confounding effect.

"Is it possible that somebody address the point of this question and others like it? Are we supposed to look at only composite results for both? Do we only look at DHA or DHA and AA? Do we look at both breastfeeding sets of scores? If I knew or could help I would. You won't be revealing anything crucial to the outcome. People will still need to make computations and then make a decision.I'm not sure why, but there is excessive concern about revealing anything on these forums. If I was taking the test in a class room with the Professor, I could ask her this question and I'm pretty sure she would clarify.I've worked out all of the percent changes, for every pair of $eta$ values. I've computed averages of various groups of results including and average for the total of changes in each group. The issue is not how to do any of the computations or how to determoine an answer if I had a single pair of $eta$ values. It's just: What results are we supposed to be considering. The description is somewhat ambiguous.We get two types of answers to these types of questions. The condecending version: \I think it's clear if you just think about it.\"" and the condescending that includes a treasure map: \""I think it will be clear if you rewatch video A, B, and C.\""There is a difference between giving somebody the solution: \""Use 27.3 as your result\"". And helping with understanding the wording or point of a question. It's even OK to tell somebody what video A, B, or C actually said.The level of reluctance to sharing understanding keeps reminding me of the federal government abusing the idea of making documents \""secret\"". Often it is unneccessary and doesn't help.The wording refers only to \""feeding method\"" which suggests we look at the results for both groups in table 2, while she explicitly says \""DHA concentration\"" which suggests we only look at one group in table 2. Those statements suggest we compare 12 pairs of $eta$ values in table 2 to 6 pairs of $eta$ values in table 3. In addition, what the heck does Composite mean? I've hunted and can't find it. If that's the only pairs we should consider, which has been suggested by questions, then we compare both composite pairs in table 2 to one pair in table 3? Furthermore, if you look at the results for all pairs in one table to all pairs in the other, results are not consistent. Some pairs in table 2 have larger percent changes than some in table 3 and vice versa.

"Hi to everybody, I was wondering if someone could help me about how to work with a variable made according to a categorization or a sorting scheme into five categories. I’m working in a interlaboratory study for estimating the repeatability and reproducibility of some tests.  We are supposed to use a procedure described in a reference standard (ASTM E 691). In this procedure they work with means, standard deviations, and apply for example statistics such as Grubb’s test or Cochran’s test to check if there are means and standard deviations exceptionallly high or low (relatively easy to make with continous measurements)…The problem is that in one test, the variable measured is a visual assessment of the damages produced, The codificaton is made according to the numerical rating; 5 = No change, 4 = minor change, 3 = moderate change, 2 = significant change and 1 = strong change. I don’t know if it makes sense taking a mean of this kind of variable and follow the prodecure indicated in the standard. Even they seem to be categorical data, there is a intrinsic meaning in this kind of data, I mean, it’s not like a categorical data where 5 = red, 4 = blue, 3 = black…What it your opinion?Thanks to everybody in advance!",0,68,206,87.48,42.3,39.59,25.77,34.33,26.21,76.21,46.6,9.71,4.37,2.43,0.49,0.49,0,0.97,5.34,8.74,13.59,5.83,3.88,6.31,1.46,14.56,3.88,0.97,1.46,5.34,0.49,2.91,1.46,1.46,0,0,0.49,4.37,0,0,0,0,22.33,6.8,5.83,2.43,8.25,0.97,3.4,1.94,1.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.31,1.46,1.94,2.43,0.97,0.49,1.94,11.17,0,9.22,3.4,5.34,0.49,4.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.42,3.4,6.31,0,0.49,0.49,0.49,0,0,2.43,1.94,3.88

"This is the difference between paying for education and getting it for free.  If you want a lecturer to mark your work, you need to enrol in a paid-for course.  There is no way you can expect getting graded by a lecturer in a MOOC.I also got reviews on my submissions that I did not like. That just inspired me to write better ones - and I did in the end. Peer reviews are good - especially since someone, possibly without proper skills have to mark your work.  It gets you to really simplify your submissions to the point of almost being bed-time stories rather than boring regurgitation of data and results.I learned a lot in the process and I did all three essays each time scoring better marks.  This to me, indicates that the process actually works - I may not be perfect but on average it does.Rather than complaining, say thank you for the opportunity to have access to quality education for free.",0,131,166,76.48,42.82,24.54,96.07,23.71,20.48,88.55,56.63,15.66,10.24,5.42,0,4.82,0,0,5.42,6.63,16.87,7.23,5.42,4.22,1.81,13.86,6.02,3.01,0,0.6,2.41,7.23,6.02,1.2,0,0,0,7.23,0,0,0,0,15.66,1.2,1.2,3.61,3.61,1.81,6.63,0.6,0,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.24,0,4.22,1.2,6.63,0,3.01,10.84,1.2,7.23,0,4.82,2.41,9.04,0,0.6,2.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.45,6.02,2.41,0,0,0,0,3.01,0,0,0,0

"Hi everyone and staff,I just want to share I really enjoyed the course. I thought the lectures were instructive and engaging. I learned many tools on effective writing. Also I was happy with my peer reviews (no, not all 100s, but they were fair reviews)However, the amount of technical issues was quite frustrating. Not only grading peer reviews (I apologize to whomever I graded and the glitch happened), but also homework submissions, homework deadlines and any other technical glitches that have been listed. All of the people that had issues with these glitches had their grades affected (I am one of them too..) and that part is unfortunate, because now our final grade doesn't necessary reflect our progress in the paper. A suggestion to the staff: the same way they allowed the quizzes to have no end date, I would suggest allowing ALL 3 homework's to be completed until the end of this week, and hopefully that will help offset some of the grades from glitches in peer grading. I am not sure there's an easy fix to the peer grading glitch. Thank you all! And I wish everyone gained some better writing skills from this course!",0,138,199,46.68,42.04,18.31,91.3,18.09,22.61,89.95,52.26,15.08,9.55,6.03,1.01,0.5,0,2.01,5.53,7.04,9.55,8.54,5.03,7.04,3.02,13.07,3.52,1.01,0.5,1.01,5.03,6.03,5.03,1.01,0,0.5,0,9.55,0,0.5,0,0,16.58,2.01,2.51,2.01,2.51,4.52,4.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.04,2.51,2.01,3.02,1.01,0,5.53,6.03,1.51,5.53,0,2.01,3.52,13.07,0,1.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.58,5.03,4.52,0.5,0,0,1.01,0,0,1.51,3.02,0
"First - if this course wasn't for free, I'd pay for it as did for another courses of interest. Second - I prefer that my work was either assessed by validated system or not assessed at all rather than got marks and comments from people who possibly even didn't read my work and checked the grades just to get the required number of reviews to see theirs.Third - I don't see any benefits from the \zero\"" grades assessments without any corrections or comments on my text.

"Hi,I submitted Essay 3, which was an improvement of my Essay 1. I was reading some of the comments/posts on Essay 3, that say that if Essay 3 is an improved version of a previously submitted essay, at least 5% of it must be different from the previous version, only then will it be peer-reviewed and graded. So my question to you moderators/co-ordinators is- Were we supposed to copy and paste both the previous version and the improved version in the box where we submitted essay 3?? How will the reviewers know what changes were made, and how to grade the new essay? More importantly, I did not see instructions to submit both the previous version and the new improved version of the essays, so I only pasted my improved version as Essay 3. Will it get peer-reviewed and graded??Also, some people taking this course posted on this board that they did not receive any new scores after submitting a new essay 3.

Hi I also have the same problem. I decided to redo my assignment 1 although it will not make any large difference in my overall grade but I thought it would benefit me regardless. I just had a look at my peer reviews and was really angry to see one reviewer has given me 0 in all sections except one? Another reviewer has given me 0 in the first section and then another reviewer has given me full marks?I have gotten between 12/15 in the first round so I know it cant be that bad.

"You mean those who did really well in getting 88 or 89% but just 'want' a distinction?

"Hello,My mentor always said to reserve anything that we got after conducting a study for the Results sections, but I have seen several articles where the authors included the results in the Methods section, even in esteemed journals such as JAMA. Look at the example below (excerpt of an article on domestic violence published in JAMA in 2011:> BlockquoteRandom-stratified, multistage area probability sampling was used to select a nationally representative sample. In-scope persons aged 16 to 85 years were the usual residents of the private dwellings.11 - 12 A total of 14 805 dwellings were included from the initial pool of 17 352 households, after excluding those that were ineligible or out of scope. An algorithm was applied to randomly select 1 person from each household without replacement for refusals. A total of 8841 respondents completed the full interview, representing an overall response rate of 60%. A response rate of 65% was imputed for women participants based on the unweighted data and the gender distribution of the Australian population. Of the total number of nonresponders (n = 5964), 61% (n = 3638) were full refusals, household information was obtained but not an interview in 27% (n = 1610), and the remaining 12% (n = 716) provided partial or incomplete information. A follow-up study of nonresponders suggested that there were slight biases in the proportional representation of men, young adults, and the population of 1 city (Perth), but the effects on overall prevalence rates of mental disorder were assessed to be insignificant.12 The ABS-trained interviewers conducted face-to-face computer-assisted interviews with respondents.12 > BlockquoteShouldn't the number of dwellings included in the study and the response rate be included in the Results section instead? I appreciate your response.",0,106,292,99,59.47,24.09,12.23,32.44,33.22,72.6,41.44,3.42,1.71,1.03,0.34,0.34,0,0,1.71,10.96,16.78,4.79,2.05,3.42,1.03,7.53,3.77,1.03,0.34,7.88,3.42,1.71,0.34,1.37,1.03,0,0,6.85,0,0,0.34,0.34,11.99,1.37,3.42,0.34,3.08,1.71,3.08,1.03,0.68,0.34,0,1.03,1.03,0,0,0,3.42,0.68,0.34,2.05,0.68,0,7.19,1.71,0,11.64,0.68,8.22,2.74,3.42,0.34,1.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.15,2.74,4.11,0.34,0,0.34,0,2.74,0,0.34,3.77,3.77

I don't expect people plagiarizing like that to be prepared to put a lot of work into their reviews! One of my first reviewers certainly didn't, and another apparently had problems with the resetting of the marks when adding text - at least that's how I explain getting a 0 in one category while the others were quite good (and summed up in 11) - my median grade. Thus, I ended up with an 11 instead of a 13 or 14 in the first attempt on the first essay.So I revised and got 15/10/3, which left me with a 10 - worse than before.In assignment 2, I got 14/13/9.For assignment 3, I submitted the revised essay 1 again without any alterations, and got 13/11/13.Thanks to handing in early and repeatedly, my overall score is now 93%. I wouldn't have been able to achieve this if I had not revised essay 1 and handed in a third essay. However, it all depends on how serious your reviewers take their job.(Two of the twelve reviewers of my essays also supplied very helpful comments, and I learned a lot from them, while the others didn't bother.)",1,162,277,65.1,19.32,68.11,59.98,39.57,17.33,83.39,53.79,13.72,8.66,6.5,0,1.08,0,1.08,5.05,7.58,14.8,6.5,6.5,8.3,2.89,13.72,4.33,2.53,1.81,11.19,2.89,5.42,3.61,1.81,0.36,0.36,0,5.05,0,0,0,0,14.44,1.44,1.81,1.44,4.69,1.08,5.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.55,0.72,4.33,1.81,4.69,1.08,6.14,6.5,0.72,11.91,0.36,6.14,5.42,6.14,0.36,0,0,0,0,0.36,0,0,0,0.36,0,18.77,4.69,5.42,0,0,0,0.36,1.08,0,2.89,1.44,2.89

I logged on about an hour ago (1300hr AEDT on 23 Nov in Australia), thinking I still had an hour to finish it before 7pm on 22 Nov in the Pacific timezone, but then saw the email saying the \The course has now closed!\"". I hadn't noticed the change to UTC prior to this (I had just assumed the the course would keep to a consistent time zone for the duration of the course) and all I had left to do was the final exam - so I did it anyway, but it did not save my answers. But I selected my answers and clicked 'Show Answers' afterwards, and i got 20/21 correct answers.

"I really enjoyed this course. I am grateful to Professor Kristin <redacted> and all the soldiers behind this great project. You are serving humanity by disseminating knowledge!! Imagine how many junior researches will benefit from this course to move science forward!! I am sure I have thousands of classmates who share me the same opinion. I am glad I passed with distinction (97%), but I do believe that the valuable knowledge I gained throughout this course is much worth than just a score. For those who are frustrated with the peer review (I do agree it’s sometimes unfair and unprofessional), try looking at the big picture! This course reshaped my way of thinking and breached the fear I had towards scientific writing.

"Here is my point:I work in evolutionary ecology. When learning from the course, some of the rules were very rare to me; I thought that they could be appropriate to medical science but not to evolutionary ecology or biological science in general. Nothing of the sort: I realized that the papers I liked the most, were written in such a similar way, close to these course recommendations.I think that, to use the active voice or to use verbs instead of nouns (maybe there are other rules more subjective), are recommendations that do not follow a kind of fashion. I really believe that these options appeal to our brain, to how our brain decodifies the language. I am not an expertise in this field, maybe someone else may explain it or correct me. Of course, from my point of view, our culture influences also on how our brain works the language. So it is possible that these recommendations work for english language and USA or UK cultures. Particularly, I am from a region where people uses to go around and around and around again to say: can you give me the salt?

"If I may add a further comment at this late stage. Kristin has provided figures showing that around a quarter of those who passed the course achieved a 'Distinction' mark. This is surely a reasonable proportion and justifies the figure chosen. As a number of posters have observed, whatever the issues with the peer assessment system, there seem to be no complaints from those who failed even to reach the 'Pass' mark.If a grade boundary is set, even where it is for a non-credit course, there will be some who are above and some below. If a threshold is set too low then it becomes meaningless--the 'prizes for all' culture common in British schools, for example--while if set too high it becomes unachievable and in either case ceases to be an incentive to greater effort.",0,480,139,79.62,44.28,44.33,52.78,27.8,20.86,82.73,55.4,9.35,0.72,0.72,0,0,0,0,8.63,10.79,12.95,10.07,5.76,7.19,0.72,12.23,5.04,2.88,3.6,0.72,3.6,5.76,3.6,2.16,0,0,1.44,4.32,0,0,0,0,13.67,5.76,1.44,2.88,5.76,2.16,4.32,0.72,0.72,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.91,0,3.6,3.6,2.16,1.44,1.44,10.79,2.16,12.23,1.44,7.19,2.88,5.76,0,0,0.72,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.83,4.32,3.6,0,0,0,0,3.6,0,4.32,0,0

Let's try to keep things productive by following a few guidelines:(1) Search before you post - someone might have already posted an answer to your question, and it will be easier for everyone if there aren't a lot of duplicate postings.(2) Use the sub-forums, e.g. discuss homework or assignments (without posting solutions!) in the \Homework\"" forum. The sub-forum for each Case Discussion should be found in the discussion forum and after you answer the associated Case Questions.(3) Let’s follow the golden rule in all posts – write to others as you would like them to write to you.

"My concern is about the use of narcotics in abdominal pain management. I think it's okay to give the narcotic if the patient will be managed at the same medical center but otherwise in the Ugandan setting, if the patient is to be referred from a small health center ( one without operating theatre), its better not to calm down the pain at all because the general surgeons at the bigger health centers ( ones with operating theatres ) will respond to patients who are in distress faster than the calmer ones however demonstrable the signs of peritoneal irritation. they will assume the patient is either stable or not in need of immediate surgical intervention.

"Excellent insights, thank you for all the feedback.  You guys bring up some great points.  Although CT is a great test for appendicitis, there are definitely some significant barriers to its use in many practice environments.  As you all mentioned there are quite a few benefits to using ultrasound that make it another great option.  1) Less radiation (good for kids and pregnant patients)2) Lower cost3) Can be done by ER physicians (no radiologist needed) some of the benefits of ultrasound  The idea of a score like the Alvarado score is very appealing.  It involves clinical exam findings and lab findings that are available in most practice environment.  There is not a lot of validation data from the ER environment, but here is a [link][1] to one such recent article.  The authors unfortunately found that a low Alvarado score (<4) was ineffective at ruling out the diagnosis of appendicitis (sensitivity of 72%).  As the score increased however, it became more specific for appendicitis, making it a better test to rule in the diagnosis (although still imperfect).  So the rule is likely more helpful to use when it's high but can't be relied on completely.    The rule nicely highlights some of the important historical and physical exam findings that should be triggering us to consider the diagnosis of appendicitis, like: -Migration of pain-Anorexia-Nausea+vomiting-Tenderness in the RLQ-Rebound pain-Fever  [1]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0FBSD838fiJY0QwVjhja3liRVk/edit?usp=sharing",1,47,251,91.65,57.89,18.13,77.16,22.82,26.29,81.27,42.23,5.98,1.59,0,0.4,1.2,0,0,4.38,8.37,13.15,6.37,4.78,4.78,1.2,10.76,6.77,4.38,0.4,3.19,5.58,8.37,5.58,2.79,0,0,0.8,4.38,0.4,0.4,0,0.4,16.33,4.78,2.39,0.8,3.59,1.99,2.79,1.2,0,0.4,0.8,5.18,0,5.18,0.4,0.4,10.76,1.2,1.99,3.59,4.38,0,1.99,8.76,0,8.76,1.2,5.98,1.59,4.38,0.4,0,0.4,0,0,1.2,0,0.4,0,0.8,0,22.71,4.78,2.39,0.8,0,0.4,0,2.39,0,0.8,5.18,5.98

"Thank you Dr Mahadevan for the stats.  It is unfortunately something that happens in a small but real percentage of intubations.  Incidence increases in difficult airways.  Prevention by using excellent intubating technique can help (proper positioning, appropriate equipment selection, laryngeal manipulation, adjuncts).  However detection of an esophageal intubation is just as important.  We discussed some of the recognition techniques above.  When recognized, the patient must be re-intubated rapidly.  If O2 saturation is low at time of detection, re-oxygenation with BMV should be used.  When re-intubating, you should change something about your approach on the second attempt (obviously something didn't work the first time around).",1,27,107,79.64,67.97,35.01,25.77,11.89,39.25,72.9,43.93,8.41,3.74,0,0.93,2.8,0,0,4.67,6.54,14.02,9.35,5.61,5.61,0.93,12.15,3.74,0.93,1.87,1.87,1.87,5.61,2.8,2.8,0,0,0.93,5.61,0,0,0,0,16.82,1.87,3.74,3.74,4.67,1.87,3.74,0,0,0,0,0.93,0,0.93,0,0,13.08,1.87,2.8,6.54,0.93,1.87,1.87,8.41,0,16.82,2.8,8.41,5.61,1.87,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.5,8.41,5.61,0,0,0,0,2.8,0,0.93,3.74,0
"It's always important to be cycling through the possible potential reversible causes.  Some can be treated empirically, like hypoglycemia, as the therapy is very low risk, and may be life saving.

"You're exactly right.  The diagnosis of anaphylaxis doesn't require any labs.  If the patient's diagnosis was unclear labs may help rule out other possible causes. Testing serum tryptase and histamine levels, drawn during an event, can help support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis if elevated.  However normal levels do not rule out anaphylaxis, and due to the time and resources needed to obtaining this information, shouldn't be relied on in the emergency medicine setting.",1,12,73,81.85,29.17,56.08,51.4,14.6,32.88,80.82,43.84,4.11,1.37,0,0,1.37,0,0,2.74,8.22,12.33,10.96,1.37,8.22,4.11,15.07,1.37,0,0,0,1.37,1.37,1.37,0,0,0,0,4.11,0,0,0,0,23.29,5.48,1.37,5.48,8.22,1.37,6.85,0,0,0,0,5.48,0,5.48,0,0,6.85,2.74,1.37,5.48,1.37,0,2.74,8.22,1.37,15.07,0,9.59,5.48,4.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.81,6.85,5.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.48,0,0
"Very well put. IM epi and fluids are first line. However in patient who are in shock, often the perfusion to their muscle beds is inadequate to adequately absorb the IM epinephrine.  Thus IV epi is required.  There is no evidence to support a certain dosing regimen for IV epi, but most experts prefer a drip over bolus dosing to minimize dosing errors.  The dosing ranges from 2-15mcg/min titrated for effect on bp (for adults).  Dr Corey Slovis, at Vanderbilt, put together a great, simple video on how to mix an epinephrine drip, [check it out here.][1] If epinephrine is not enough to support the blood pressure and circulatory function, a second pressor can be added. There is not much evidence to help guide this choice, but some experts think that choosing a non-adrenergic agent, like vasopressin, could complement the epinephrine the patient is already receiving.   [1]: http://vimeo.com/<phoneRedac>5",1,16,157,86.15,39.93,26.31,49.48,17.44,21.66,72.61,42.68,4.46,1.91,1.27,0,0,0,0.64,2.55,7.64,12.1,8.28,6.37,4.46,1.91,10.83,1.91,1.27,1.27,3.82,2.55,5.1,3.18,1.91,1.27,0,0.64,4.46,0,0,0,0,13.38,4.46,1.91,2.55,2.55,0.64,3.82,1.27,0.64,0.64,0,5.73,1.27,5.1,0,0,7.01,1.27,1.91,3.18,1.27,0,1.27,9.55,0,10.19,2.55,5.1,3.18,1.27,0.64,0.64,0,0,0,1.27,0,0.64,0,0.64,0,22.93,6.37,6.37,0.64,0,0,0,1.27,0,0,1.27,7.01

"Excellent question! These terms are often used interchangeably and it can become quite confusing. Anaphylaxis can lead to a type of shock (lack of oxygen on a tissue level associated with low blood pressure). In fact, low blood pressure is part of the diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis. However, low blood pressure is not required to make the diagnosis! Therefore, physicians sometimes use the diagnosis of anaphylactic shock to describe a patient who has hypotension from an allergen. Whereas, anaphylaxis is used to describe an allergic reaction that meets certain criteria but does not include low blood pressure (e.g. rash + respiratory compromise; rash + gastrointestinal compromise). Hope this helps!",1,12,107,91.34,38.95,24.3,1,13.38,34.58,85.05,40.19,4.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.67,7.48,12.15,8.41,2.8,3.74,1.87,15.89,0,0,0.93,0,0.93,14.02,3.74,10.28,4.67,0,3.74,3.74,0,0,0,0,23.36,4.67,6.54,1.87,5.61,1.87,4.67,0,0,0,0,11.21,5.61,7.48,0,0,10.28,3.74,1.87,4.67,0,0.93,1.87,16.82,0.93,9.35,0.93,6.54,1.87,3.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.63,6.54,3.74,0,0.93,0,2.8,0,0,0,3.74,1.87

"thanks for the comments everyone.  Just to add a little clarity.  The bougie is a tool that provides a guide over which to pass the endotracheal tube into the trachea.  In a difficult airway, when you are unable to pass the ETT through the vocal cords, the more slender, bendable bougie can be passed through the cords first.  Then this can be used as guide (just as a guide wire is used in central line placement).

Asystole and PEA are not shockable rhythms.  These are treated with medications per ACLS.  Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are shockable rhythms.  Ventricular fibrillation is always pulseless and treated with defibrillation.  Ventricular tachycardia may be present with or without a pulse.  Ventricular tachycardia is treated with defibrillation if the patient is without a pulse.  Ventricular tachycardia is treated with synchronized cardioversion if the patient is unstable and with a pulse.  Ventricular tachycardia can be medically managed if the patient is stable and with a pulse.,1,18,85,74.42,11.97,4.15,3.42,10.62,44.71,64.71,47.06,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,8.24,10.59,15.29,0,10.59,3.53,15.29,0,0,0,0,0,2.35,0,2.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.59,0,0,3.53,5.88,1.18,8.24,0,0,0,0,8.24,4.71,3.53,0,0,1.18,0,0,1.18,0,0,1.18,15.29,1.18,5.88,0,0,5.88,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.41,9.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"This is very true!  Although about 1.1 million children die from pneumonia every year, it also is dangerous to all adults, and particularly elderly adults. Between 5 and 10 million people get pneumonia in the United States each year, and more than 1 million people are hospitalized due to the condition. About 500,000 children are hospitalized for respiratory infections each year, and a third of them have pneumonia. For patients who need hospitalization for pneumonia, the death rate is 10 - 25%. If pneumonia develops in patients already hospitalized for other conditions, death rates range from 50 - 70%.Particularly sensitive populations (other than children) are older adults (Older adults have lower survival rates than younger people), pregnant women (can lead to premature labor), individuals with HIV/AIDs, other immunocompromised individuals, those with diabetes, cirrhosis, sickle cell disease, and patients with cancer.  (Although I provide some data from the United States, pneumonia is a big problem worldwide, and may effect populations in developing nations even more profoundly).",1,9,166,86.63,66.35,11.7,10.54,23.71,30.72,75.9,38.55,5.42,1.2,0.6,0,0,0,0.6,4.22,3.61,13.86,6.63,4.82,6.02,0,7.83,7.83,5.42,0.6,8.43,4.22,2.41,0.6,1.81,0,0,0.6,10.24,0.6,0,0.6,0,12.05,0.6,1.2,1.81,1.81,3.01,5.42,0,0,0,0,7.23,0,7.23,1.81,0,6.02,0,1.2,3.61,0.6,1.2,0.6,8.43,0.6,9.04,0.6,3.61,4.82,2.41,0,0,0,0,1.81,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.29,4.22,9.64,0,0,0,0.6,1.2,0,0,4.82,1.81

"In the critical care and emergency situation you will have to occassionally initiate treatments that are later altered.  You want to focus on the items that are very time dependent.  So in your case with pneumonia, if it is viral the treatment is supportive and anti-virals do not need to be emergently given in most cases.  If the cause is fungal, these are rare and do not often present with rapid decompensation (worsening).

"For those that conceptually understand the difference between mutually exclusive and independent events but want to see it make sense mathematically when a certain event [i.e. P(A)=1] and an impossible event [assume P(~A)=0 because A is certain to occur] occur “together,” note that their joint probability will be one [P(A & ~A)=1], not zero. That’s because the probability of such an event happening and not happening is certain; let’s assume that it’s raining right now, then we can be certain that it’s also not not raining [in other words, it's impossible that it's not raining]. Thus, P(A & ~A), which is one, is not equal to P(A) * P(~A), which is zero.

"Excellent question. In emergency situations the physician is often forced to act with limited information. You may not know the patient's medical history nor the most likely cause of acute decompensation. In a patient in shock, immediate intervention is required. This often involves plenty of fluids!Remember, however, that there are some excellent clues from the physical exam that can lead you to a quick diagnosis. Just to name a few: hypoxia, shortness of breath and hypotension = obstructive shock from tension pneumothorax (needle the chest!); elevated neck veins, muffled heart sounds = tamponade (pericadiocentesis!); fever and cough with hypotension = combination of distributive and hypovolemic shock from sepsis (lots of fluids and possible vasopressors); shortness of breath, rales, elevated neck veins and worse symptoms with fluids may = cardiogenic shock (ionotropes!)Ultimately, it can become an exercise in trial and error with multiple interventions and reassessment!",1,13,143,91.87,55.55,9.94,2.03,23.83,32.87,74.83,40.56,4.2,1.4,0,0,1.4,0,0,2.8,6.29,13.99,5.59,4.2,6.29,1.4,5.59,2.8,1.4,0,0,4.2,5.59,1.4,4.2,0.7,0,0,3.5,0,0,0,0,14.69,4.2,2.1,0,6.99,0,2.1,0.7,0,0.7,0,11.89,5.59,6.29,0,0,4.2,0,2.8,1.4,0,0.7,0.7,5.59,1.4,6.99,0.7,2.8,3.5,3.5,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.48,3.5,5.59,0.7,2.1,0,3.5,0,0,0.7,5.59,2.8

"To likely answer your question, if a child meets the criteria for a \simple febrile seizure\"", has no evidence of a neurologic infection (meningitis or encephalitis), and returns to a normal neurologic exam -> then there is no need to treat with antiepileptic medication or to further investigate for cause of seizure.  The definition of a **simple febrile seizure** is as follows:The setting is fever in a child aged 6 months to 5 yearsThe single seizure is generalized and lasts less than 15 minutes (< 5 minutes by newer definitions)The child is otherwise neurologically healthy and without neurologic abnormality by examination or by developmental historyFever (and seizure) is not caused by meningitis, encephalitis, or any other illness affecting the brainThe seizure is described as either a generalized clonic or a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.**Simple** febrile seizures do not usually require anticonvulsant therapy, as they are generally short, and you are often seeing the child after it has ended.  However, any active seizure should be treated as emergent and life threatening.  You will not know a simple febrile seizure is \""simple\"" until it has ended (because the duration of the seizure may make it \""complex\"").  Definition of **Complex febrile seizure**Age, neurologic status before the illness, and fever are the same as for simple febrile seizureThis seizure is either focal or prolonged (ie, >15 min), or multiple seizures occur in close successionHope this helps!""",1,6,239,84.58,33.77,41.21,65.41,47.8,32.22,85.36,45.19,4.18,1.67,0,0,1.26,0,0.42,2.51,8.79,12.13,8.37,2.09,10.46,2.51,13.81,11.72,5.86,0,2.51,2.93,2.93,2.51,0.42,0.42,0.42,0,4.6,0,0,0,0,17.57,3.77,2.09,2.09,6.69,0,7.53,0.42,0.42,0,0,12.55,0.42,12.13,0,0,3.77,0.84,0,2.93,0,0.42,0.84,10.46,1.67,10.46,0.42,2.09,7.95,1.67,0,0,0.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.27,2.09,5.02,0.42,0,0,0.42,0.84,2.51,0,4.18,8.79

"In this exercise we are interested in median daily lipstick usage. This would represent the typical exposure. As Dr. <redacted> discussed in the video, the data we are dealing with (from the larger sample) is right skewed. If you compare the mean from the 2009 smaller sample and the mean from the 2012 larger sample, you might want to jump to the conclusion that the lead in lipstick increased from 2009 to 2012. This is not correct. We are actually detecting a bigger maximum in the larger sample because we have a right skewed distribution. In the sample of 22, you are less likely to find the extreme values. When you sample more, you are going to see more of the infrequent extreme events. When calculating the mean, you take all the numbers in the dataset, add them together, and divide them by the number of entries. Since your are adding all the numbers, extreme values can influence the mean. With the median, which is the 50% point in the data, infrequent extreme values generally will not impact the value. In this example, we are interested in a value that is representative of our entire sample. The mean is not the best choice because it is influenced by outliers. Hope this helps!Josh",1,264,213,93.68,86,29.91,95.49,15.21,18.78,84.04,52.58,11.27,7.04,0,2.82,3.29,0,0.94,4.23,13.62,13.62,8.45,1.88,3.76,1.41,14.08,11.27,5.16,1.41,2.82,7.04,4.69,4.69,0,0,0,0,8.45,0,0,0,0,13.62,3.76,2.82,1.88,2.35,1.88,2.35,0.94,0.94,0,0,1.41,0.94,0.47,0,0,9.39,3.76,0.94,4.23,1.88,0,0,13.15,1.88,13.62,1.88,8.92,2.82,0.47,0.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.55,6.57,5.16,0,0,0,0.47,0,0,0,0.94,1.41

"Good question!Overall, I think it really also depends on what you are trying to measure. Generally, the median is preferred over the mean when the data is skewed (this is because the median is more robust). If you are dealing with a normal distribution and the data is completely normal, then the mean and median should be identical. With a normal distribution, using the mean is often a good choice.Best,Josh",1,264,73,55.02,60.81,22.36,92,18.25,16.44,83.56,57.53,8.22,4.11,1.37,0,2.74,0,0,4.11,13.7,6.85,13.7,8.22,9.59,0,23.29,12.33,4.11,2.74,0,1.37,4.11,4.11,0,0,0,0,4.11,0,0,0,0,24.66,9.59,4.11,4.11,9.59,1.37,2.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.85,0,2.74,2.74,4.11,0,0,19.18,1.37,6.85,0,2.74,4.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.44,5.48,6.85,0,0,0,1.37,0,0,0,2.74,0
"There are some strange things with the Unit 1 Module 4 Quiz. It is hard to describe them without revealing the answer but I'll try.The question is of the type \which is true\"". There are 5 alternatives: a&lt;b, a&lt;=b, a=b, a&gt;=b, and a&gt;b.If one and only one of those is true then, in reality, there are only 3 alternatives: a&lt;=b, a=b, a&gt;=b, since there are no numbers a and b where a&lt;b is true but a&lt;=b is false (the same goes for a&gt;b and a&gt;=b).Thus if a&lt;b is true in the quiz, then a&lt;=b must also be true. The answer to the question must be in the set {(a&lt;b, a&lt;=b), (a&lt;=b), (a=b), (a&gt;=b), (a&gt;b, a&gt;=b)} (otherwise the question should be reformulated: maybe something like \""a&lt;b\"", \""a&lt;=b, and a=b for some Y\"", \""a=b\"" etc).The question deals with medians, means and skewness. The definition of skewness has been informal. Something in the line with: \""the sample is left skew if it has a left tail\"", but what is a tail?It is possible to construct a sample that looks somewhat like it has a tail but defies the correct answer to the quiz (compare for example the sets {-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3} and {-3,-3,-3,-3,-3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3}, zeroes added to get some weight in the middle). Wikipedia and wolfram mathworld to rescue! It is always nice with a definition, but in this case there is more than one. For the definition of nonparametric skew the quiz answer is correct (well, not entirely, see the discussion above), but not for the general definition of skewness.""",0,182,341,94.28,33,6.75,59.07,37.89,11.44,72.43,47.8,4.4,0.59,0.29,0,0,0,0.29,3.81,15.54,9.38,8.21,3.81,6.16,1.17,10.85,4.11,2.05,0.88,13.2,2.64,2.35,2.05,0.29,0,0,0,1.76,0,0,0,0,15.54,4.11,0.59,1.76,4.69,3.23,4.69,1.47,0.88,0,0.59,0.29,0,0,0,0.29,1.17,0,0.29,0.29,0.59,0,1.17,8.8,0.88,4.69,0.29,3.23,1.17,1.47,0,0,0,0,0,7.92,0,7.62,0,0.29,0,56.3,3.52,18.18,1.17,5.87,0.29,0.29,2.93,2.93,0.29,5.28,15.54

"That's a tough question. Medical data is endless, since you can measure anything you want, from the concentration of a certain molecule with specific traits to the size of fingernails.If you want personal impressions of one researcher, it will vary based on his working field. A doctor working on hypertension and diabetes will get many normal distributions. In nuclear medicine, you can deal with exponencial ones a little more.However, if you want to know why the normal distribution is so important to us, it is because of one math theorem called \Central limit theorem\"". In a \""for dummies\"" way to say it, states that, regardless of the distribution in the population, if you take independent samples from it, the means on these samples will assume a normal distribution.Watch this video at 3:33 to see one comprehensive simulation:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXZ2O1Lv-KEDon't know if this exactly what you were looking for, but I hope someone in the discussion forum will be as amazed as I was when I first learned this.Best regards,Felipe""",1,169,183,80.83,77.79,5.64,83.88,36.6,25.14,84.7,48.63,13.66,6.56,1.64,0.55,3.83,0.55,0,7.1,7.1,14.75,7.65,2.19,6.56,0.55,16.39,6.56,2.19,1.64,3.28,2.19,4.37,3.28,0,0,0,0,8.74,0,0,0,0.55,17.49,4.37,2.73,4.92,6.56,1.64,3.28,3.83,2.73,0.55,0.55,3.28,0.55,2.73,0,0,5.46,0.55,2.73,1.64,1.64,0,2.19,12.02,2.73,7.65,0,6.01,1.64,3.28,1.09,0,0,0,0,0.55,0,0.55,0,0,0,21.31,5.46,6.56,1.09,0,0.55,0,0.55,2.19,1.09,0,3.83

"Dear Ceg,Thanks for sharing your question. There is actually already a discussion \Unit 1 Module 4 Quiz\"" if you are interested in joining that group.It sounds like you are understanding the principle! Yes, it does depend on how exactly the values fall. So what happens if you have a distribution with a significant left skew and a single high-value outlier? If the single right outlier is very extreme, it may be the case that you no longer have a left skew. It could also be a miscoded data point (a mistake measurement). If there is one right outlier (that may not be as extreme), it will not have an impact on the median. If it still has a significant left skew (even with the one outlier to the right), what effect will having a left tail have on the mean?...in what direction will it pull the mean? Since in the example you give, you say that there is still a significant left skew, even with the outlier on the right, it should still pull the mean in the direction that you expect (not trying to completely give away the quiz solution!) Hope this helps!""",1,89,198,62.04,72.77,34.98,86.82,19.8,15.15,86.36,59.09,12.63,4.04,0,0,4.04,0,0,8.59,13.13,9.09,11.62,7.58,5.05,2.02,22.22,5.05,1.52,2.02,3.03,1.52,4.55,4.04,0.51,0,0,0,8.59,0,0.51,0,0,14.65,3.54,2.53,5.05,5.56,1.01,4.55,1.01,0,1.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.04,2.53,1.01,0.51,0,0,3.03,13.13,3.54,15.66,1.52,11.62,2.53,1.01,0,0,0,0,0,0.51,0,0,0.51,0,0,18.18,4.55,4.04,0,0,1.52,1.52,0.51,1.01,0,4.04,1.01

"Thanks alot for your explanation , but according the quiz, it was mentioned that in case of left skewed data ( meaning the bulk is right sided) which of the following answer would be true, basically what i understand that left shwed data meaning that the bulk is right!

"Hello Hany,Let me start with an numerical example.. Say you have:0 0 0 0 1 10 10 10 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 15 15 15  15 15 15 15 15 16 16 16 17 17 17 Do you notice how the \bulk\"" of the data has values ranging from 10 to 17? Furthermore, the 0 and 1's look like outliers? The median is the value that lies at the midpoint. In this example, the \""bulk\"" of data occurs in the right portion. The \""tail\"" extends to the left and contains extremely small values. These small values will pull the mean of the distribution towards the values located at the tail. The mean is calculated using all the data and median is not influenced by the values of the min and max. Picture an image of a skewed distribution in your head (or draw one on a piece of paper). Think of the mean as the balance point of the distribution. In a symmetric distribution, the \""balancing point\"" would be in the center. When the data is skewed, you have points that are further away from the balance point, so the center of balance is changed. The mean (center of balance) needs to be pulled in the direction of the skewed data. The median is still just the point that cuts the distribution in half.""",1,219,257,98.71,59.22,20.02,62.66,18.36,11.67,59.92,41.63,3.89,1.95,0.39,0,1.56,0,0,1.95,14.4,12.45,6.23,2.33,3.5,0.39,12.06,3.11,1.17,0.78,24.12,0.78,2.72,2.33,0.39,0,0.39,0,2.33,0,0,0,0,6.23,2.33,1.56,0.78,0.39,0.78,0.78,1.56,1.17,0.39,0,0.39,0.39,0,0,0,1.56,0.39,0,1.17,0,0,0.78,8.95,0.39,13.23,1.17,10.51,1.56,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.73,5.06,2.33,0.39,0,0.78,0,0,3.11,0.39,1.56,3.11

"Ok, one question on this: do the Q1 and Q3 have to be \real\"" numbers from the data set? In the example you propose Q1 and Q3 fall between two real numbers from the set, so you calculate the mean of these two (10-11 and 14-15).  I ask this 'cause someone said, in another subdiscussion, that you should round it up to the nearest whole number; but doing so in this case results in a different IQR. On the other hand, does it make sense that ie 25th percentile is not a real number? I mean, by this method, you're calculating a mean (which is not a real numb from the data set) of two values.

"I'm not sure where you got the 37.9 from but it might be errors with the negative numbers. Not really sure. To calculate the standard deviation you first have to know what the mean is. So when you find the mean you should get -18.5.The standard deviation means you have to look at how far away each sample is away from the mean. One way to do this by hand is to organize it in a table and subtract the mean from each x-value. Then you can find the squared deviations, the sum of the squared deviations, divide by (n-1), and then take the square root. I have attached a picture to show the work by hand. It is most likely just a computational error. There are many other ways to calculate this in a calculator, Excel spreadsheet, or other statistical software. Since this is such a small sample, it is a nice one to show by hand how it truly is calculated.![enter image description here][1]  [1]: https://edx-west-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1<phoneRedac><phoneRedac>61.jpg",1,88,185,78.87,54.31,26.86,83.44,18.5,14.59,77.84,52.43,10.27,4.32,1.08,0,3.24,0,0,5.95,10.27,12.43,9.19,5.95,5.41,1.62,15.68,4.86,0.54,2.7,5.41,3.24,3.24,3.24,0,0,0,0,4.32,0,0,0,0,14.05,4.32,2.16,0.54,2.16,1.62,3.78,5.95,3.24,1.08,1.62,1.62,1.62,0,0,0,3.78,0,1.62,0.54,1.62,0,0.54,15.68,1.62,8.65,0.54,5.41,2.7,2.16,0,0,0,0,0,0.54,0,0.54,0,0,0,23.24,8.11,3.24,0.54,0,0,0.54,2.7,0,0.54,1.08,6.49

"Hello,So your mean value is correct. I think you are getting confused about the absolute value part. In the video that one way to deal with \Getting rid of negatives is absolute values.\"" In general, absolute values help deal with negatives. However, they are also complicated and should not be used when calculating the SD. When it comes to calculating the SD, you square the distances from the mean. This way, (-300-(-34.5)) does not result in a negative value..The SD is the square root of the average of the squared differences from the mean. So your equation would be Sqrt((Sigma(Xi-Xmean)^2))/(n-1))Sigma = summation Xi= the individual numbers -4, -3, 0, etc.So let me set up the first few for you..Sqrt ( ((4 - (-34.5))^2 + (3 - (-34.5))^2 + (0 - (-34.5))^2 + ...... + (-300 - (-34.5))^2)) / (10-1)As you can see, (4-(-34.5))^2 is the same as (4+34.5)^2. Let me know if this helps,Josh""",1,125,165,73.59,59.58,10.08,80.64,18.33,13.94,69.7,44.85,8.48,6.06,1.82,0,3.64,0,0.61,2.42,9.09,10.3,8.48,4.85,6.67,3.03,14.55,7.88,2.42,1.21,17.58,1.82,4.24,3.64,0.61,0.61,0,0,6.67,0,0,0,0,12.73,3.64,1.82,1.82,1.21,2.42,3.03,2.42,2.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.24,1.82,0.61,1.21,1.21,0,0.61,10.91,0,6.67,0.61,4.24,1.82,0,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,66.06,11.52,6.06,0,0,0,0,11.52,1.21,0,24.85,10.91

"Good Question!Overall, all research has certain flaws. WIth RCT, the strength is that you randomly assign individuals to either an intervention or control group. This minimizes the observed and unobserved systematic differences between the two groups. You are correct that in certain cases the outcomes may not be generalizable to the entire population. There is a clear trade off between internal validity and external validity. Even if they may not always be the gold standard, that does not mean the RCT should not be used. It just means that in certain cases, there should be additional forms of evidence used.

"I think I might be able to help you with your question about why RCTs are not generalisable. From a clinical perspective the problem with randomised trials is that the people designing the trials usually want a fairly homogenous group of paricipants, often people with co-morbidities are excluded and children and pregnant women are almost always excluded. This means that when you're sitting in your clinic room trying to decide whether a particular treatment might be good for the patient sitting in front of you the trial evidence may well not be readily applicable to them i.e. if they're of a different gender, age, ethnicity etc from the participants in the trial. Well conducted randomised controlled trials are the gold standard for trial design but from an evidence based medicine perspective a well conducted systematic review and meta-analysis (pooling of the evidence and potentially the statistics) of good quality randomised trials will give you more reliable evidence.",1,126,159,86.26,77.48,36.1,72.83,39.75,28.3,77.99,49.06,7.55,5.66,1.26,0,3.77,0,0.63,1.89,10.06,12.58,8.81,5.66,5.03,1.26,14.47,1.89,1.89,1.89,0,1.26,3.77,3.14,0.63,0,0,0,11.32,0.63,0,0.63,0,21.38,6.92,1.89,1.89,6.92,0.63,5.03,0,0,0,0,2.52,0,2.52,0.63,0,6.92,1.26,1.89,2.52,1.26,0.63,0,9.43,3.14,7.55,0,4.4,3.14,1.26,0.63,0.63,0,0,0,1.89,0,0,0,1.89,0,9.43,3.77,1.89,0,0,0,0,1.26,0,1.26,1.26,0

let me try. Standard deviation arises from them sampling from the original distribution of the mean. The more sample size - the shorter the standard deviation. Standard error of the mean - its a relationship between standard deviation in the original distribution of the mean and increase in sample size which will give new distribution of the mean. Mean will stay the same in original and new distribution of the mean. The only change will be in the standard deviation. With increase in sample size increases the chance that new distribution of the mean will have normal shape (i mean with no or minimal skew) even the original distribution of the mean was skewed or bi-modal - and standard deviation will decrease.,1,273,120,98.58,43.37,65.14,84.54,17.14,25,77.5,48.33,5,2.5,1.67,0,0,0,0.83,2.5,15,14.17,7.5,1.67,4.17,0.83,17.5,16.67,2.5,0.83,0,4.17,3.33,3.33,0,0,0,0,2.5,0,0,0,0,11.67,7.5,0.83,0,3.33,0,1.67,0,0,0,0,0.83,0,0,0.83,0,1.67,0.83,0.83,0,0,0,0.83,11.67,4.17,12.5,4.17,6.67,2.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.83,5.83,0,0,0,0,0,3.33,0,0,1.67,0

i think disadvantage of not being able to generalize to whole population is compensated by reduced numbers of mistakes(i mean bias) in the study compare to other study designs. The same time general population is also not homogeneous. So may be there is no need in generalization.

Could you please explain it. For example if the study was less than 1 year - 7 months. In order to calculate incidence we need person-years of follow up - should we multiply 7 month by number of people in the study. For example it was 100 people. Will it be this way - (100*7/12)-cause in a year its a 12 month. I am very confused with this. And do wee need to calculate person-years of follow-up every time we calculate incidence. Cause i used to have another calculation for incidence = (new cases of the disease divided by population at risk to have this disease at some period of time) - i didn't use person-years of follow-up in this calculation.

"HelloGood questions!So it seems like you are confusing cumulative incidence and incidence rate. CI is a proportion, it is the (# people who develop an outcome / # of people initially at risk). With the CI all people are followed for the same amount of time. For example, say you had 40 people in a STATS class and a 1-year period. 14 of these students developed pneumonia. The 1-year cumulative incidence of pneumonia (14/40) or (14/40)*100 = 35 per 100 students. A CI value has no units and the denominator is based on all people who are at risk at risk in the population. It assumes that all people are followed for the same amount of time (in this case a year), and that the population is closed (no people going in or out). Incidence rate (also called incidence density) = # of incident cases / Amount of person time at risk. The best way to think of it is as the occurrence of new cases (of a particular outcome) that arise during a certain amount of person-time of observation. The numerator for CI and incidence rate are exactly the same. The difference is that incidence rate is a true rate because it includes time. In order to understand incidence rate, one needs to talk about person-time. Person-time is only counted up until a person is diagnosed with the outcome of interest. For incidence rate, there is no assumption that everyone is followed for the same amount of time. People can exit and enter the population. So say a person is in a study for 6 months, without getting the outcome, and then drops out - they contribute 6 months to the person time of observation in the candidate population. Say a person is in the study for 12 months, without getting the outcome, and then dies - they contribute 12 months to the person time of observation in the candidate population. Say a person is in the study for 6 months and then gets diagnosed with the outcome of interest - they contribute 6 months to the person time of observation in the candidate population. If these were the only 3 people in the study, the incidence rate would be 1 / 2person-years. The numerator is 1 because 1 person had the outcome and the denominator of the incidence rate is the sum of all the person-times from each member in the candidate population (the population at risk).",1,129,410,98.26,76.04,48.21,29.86,19.52,19.76,81.71,47.8,5.12,1.22,0,0,0.49,0,0.73,3.9,12.68,16.59,6.83,1.71,5.61,1.22,11.22,2.44,2.2,0.49,5.37,2.44,3.17,1.71,1.46,1.46,0,0,9.27,0,0,0,0,8.54,1.95,2.44,0.73,1.95,1.95,1.46,0.98,0,0.98,0,0.49,0,0.49,0,0,3.9,0.49,0.24,1.22,1.22,1.22,1.71,9.02,0.98,18.05,1.22,6.34,10.24,2.2,0,0,0,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.83,5.12,2.44,0,0,0,0.24,2.44,0,0,3.9,2.68

"Hi,I started on the homework and find it quite challenging, specifically in that we are shown several measurements (for instance, blood pressure and heart rate, or exposure to different chemicals). How should that guide us when choosing a statistical test ?For instance, in question 3, suppose that we only considered blood pressure, I would have gone for a paired t-test with the following arguments: - Continuous variable  - Correlated observations (one group of people before/after exposure) - Normality assumption holdsBut since we are also measuring heart rate, I wonder how that affects our study. Should we perform a paired t-test with some adjustment for repeated measures (e.g. Bonferroni...)? Also, I have a slight doubt on the information needed to performe the test: module 1 in unit 7 states that we should calculate the change for each person, then calculate the average change.

"Alexa, on the antibiotic resistance question: \A positive test means that the patient will be less likely to respond to treatment with a specific antibiotic.\"" In this case, the condition of interest is antibiotic resistance (non-response to the antibiotic). We are trying to determine the sensitivity/specificity for the outcome of non-response (antibiotic resistance). The sensitivity will thus be the probability that if are a non-responder, you will test positive. The specificity will be the probability that if you are a responder, you will test negative.

"Romain, you're working through the course very quickly! Yes, beta coefficients can be a huge source of confusion when authors/readers don't pay close enough attention to the units. Beta coefficients are entirely unit-dependent, so you have to think very carefully about the units. However, they do have some advantages over correlation coefficients. We often want to know how much does Y increase or decrease on average for a 1-unit increase in X. The correlation coefficient doesn't tell us this. A good alternative, for continuous variables, is to standardize them by turning them into Z-scores (Standard Deviation units). If you put standardized variables into the linear regression model, then the beta coefficients will be in SD-Y/SD-X units. So for example, a beta coefficient of 0.25 tells that a 1-SD increase in X correlates to a 0.25-SD increase in Y. It's easier to compare across different predictors if they are all in SD units.",1,60,161,84.34,69.03,38.54,61.1,16.1,25.47,70.81,45.34,7.45,5.59,0,1.24,1.86,0,2.48,1.86,7.45,14.91,9.32,5.59,5.59,1.24,13.04,2.48,1.86,1.24,2.48,3.11,1.86,1.86,0,0,0,0,6.83,0,0,0,0,13.66,3.73,1.24,1.86,4.97,1.24,3.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.21,1.24,1.24,1.86,1.86,0.62,0,11.8,1.86,13.66,3.73,8.07,2.48,1.86,0,0,0.62,0,0,0.62,0,0,0.62,0,0,20.5,5.59,4.97,0,0,0,0.62,4.35,0,2.48,1.24,1.24

"Your solution to the video download problem didn't really help.

If we only download whole modules, we can't watch them with the subtitles (.srt files). For example, if I download module 4 of Unit 2, I can only watch part 1 with subtitles. After part 2 (11:17), the subtitles are gone (obviously), and if you try opening the part 2 .srt file, the subtitles will start at 00:00 instead of 11:18.I understand if there's no immediate solution for this, but this is just my two cents.

"You say in the video that one sided hypothesis tests are not common in medicine, so I kind of have a question which I think touches on some of the points which puzzle me the most.Let's say I'm examining a treatment of some sort (T) and have some measure of wellness (w) in groups who get the treatment or don't get the treatment. Wouldn't it then make sense that my null hypothesis was that the treatment resulted in as much or less wellness compared with no treatment and then that the alternative hypothesis were that the treated group had more wellness than the non-treated group?(Firstly, with one-sided hypotheses, I'm thinking that the test gains more statistical power for the case of positive effect and secondly that it wouldn't make sense to \accept\"" a hypothesis stating that a treatment has a positive *or* negative effect.)*Am I not describing a one sided hypothesis test, and wouldn't it make sense to use that design a lot of the time in medicine?Thanks for your time in advance!*Edited from something that made less sense.""",0,109,185,75.36,31.34,39.86,89.27,92.5,22.16,88.11,50.27,14.59,5.41,3.78,0.54,1.08,0,0,9.19,10.27,11.35,7.57,0.54,5.95,4.32,15.68,5.95,4.32,1.62,2.16,7.03,3.78,3.78,0,0,0,0,5.41,0,0,0,0,23.78,5.95,4.32,1.62,10.27,1.08,3.78,4.32,0.54,1.08,0.54,2.7,0,2.7,0,0,5.95,2.16,1.08,0.54,3.24,0,2.16,10.27,1.08,7.57,0.54,3.78,2.7,2.16,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.38,2.16,2.16,0,0,1.08,0.54,1.08,1.08,3.78,3.24,3.24

"Hi…Just some random questions to make sure I understand these things correctly…-Can you calculate NNT or NNH as 1/risk difference OR 1/rate difference?  Just wanted to make sure this can be done with either value or should you always use the rate difference?  And if someone reports the NNT, do you assume this was calculated as 1/rate difference vs. 1/risk difference?-It seems to me that prevalence and cumulative risk are the same except that prevalence implies you are doing a cross sectional study and cumulative risk implies that you are doing a cohort study.  So if I’m doing a cross sectional study, I would report prevalence, not cumulative risk.  If I do a cohort study, I would never report prevalence but instead cumulative risk.  Am I missing anything here?-Considering the rofecoxib vs. naproxen study: is it correct to say we don’t really know whether naproxen is more protective than rofecoxib regarding MIs or whether rofecoxib (and/or naproxen) is linked to MIs?  It seems to me that the only way you would know which statement is correct is if you had a placebo group who did not receive either drug. Then you would compare the rate of events in all these groups.  -“Well-conducted randomized controlled trials are considered the criterion standard for establishing a causal link between a risk factor and an outcome.”  Regarding this statement from the paper on study designs, I don’t really understand this.  I would think that a cohort study would be the criterion standard for this and RCTs would be the criterion standard for a causal link between an intervention and an outcome.  Thanks for clarifying.

"Hello ToDe,So the information provided allows you to create a contingency (2x2) table. We are given percentages, so it is best to just make up a baseline number of patients of 100. If you make the top row \fracture\"" and the bottom row \""no fracture,\"" then you can fill out the row total of 30 and 70. For the columns, you can make the left column >55 age and the right column =<55 age. Here \""marker\"" means an \""indicator\"" or something that identifies. So we use this as our \""test +\"" and \""test -\"" columns. This is the + or - marker for fraction! You are then told that 60% of the patients with a fracture are older than 55... So in the \""fracture\"" top row, 60% are >55. To solve for this you take the row total = 30 and multiply it by .60 (for the 60%). This gives you 18. With a row total of 30 and the \""Fraction/>55\"" intersection of 18, you can solve for the \""Fraction/=<55\"" intersection. You are then told that 60% of the patients without a fraction are older than 55. You have the row total for \""no fraction\"" = 70 ... so (.60*70) = 21. Just like above, you can solve for the \""No Fraction/=<55\"" intersection. Now your table is filled out and you can calculate the column totals!Next you want to think about what the negative predictive valueNPV = # True Negatives / # testing NegativesWhat are the true negative values? Those with  No Fracture and a negative marker (those =< 55). What are the number of testing negatives?

What is the probability that the coin chosen is the two-headed coin?The sentence states that the coin is already flipped for the first time and we got a head then it asks for the probability that the chosen coin is the two-headed coin and **NOT** asking for the probability of getting a head in the first flip (action of flipping is not performed yet).2- Suppose that the coin is thrown a second time and comes up heads again. What is the probability that the chosen coin is the fair coin?The sentence is asking for the fair coin's probability, in the second time, and **NOT** the H/H probabilityI appreciate your help and precious timeEnas",0,62,180,92.17,60.95,43.37,84.54,45,14.44,85.56,53.33,8.33,3.33,1.11,0.56,1.67,0,0,5,16.67,9.44,6.67,5.56,5,1.67,14.44,2.22,0.56,1.11,5.56,0,3.33,3.33,0,0,0,0,5.56,0,0,0,0,9.44,1.67,0.56,0,5,0,2.22,0,0,0,0,2.78,2.78,0,0,0,6.11,1.67,1.67,1.67,1.67,0,1.67,11.11,0.56,15,4.44,2.78,7.78,1.11,0,0,5.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20,2.22,2.78,0,0.56,1.11,0.56,2.22,0,1.11,2.22,7.22

"Hello,Let me start with talking about left/tail right tail. Say you have:0 0 0 0 1 10 10 10 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 16 16 16 17 17 17Do you notice how the \bulk\"" of the data has values ranging from 10 to 17? Furthermore, the 0 and 1's look like outliers? The median is the value that lies at the midpoint. In this example, the \""bulk\"" of data occurs in the right portion. The \""tail\"" extends to the left and contains extremely small values. These small values will pull the mean of the distribution towards the values located at the tail. When you have these extremely small values on the left (separated from the bulk of the data), it creates a tail. (Try drawing a picture of this or looking online). In this example, the outliers create a tail on the left side of the distribution - So it is a left tail.OR do not naturally follow a normal distribution, they have right skew. Ratio's cannot have values below zero (Try to come up with a negative ratio!). You get all kinds of values that are close to zero, but you cannot go below zero. So there is a boundary! OR can be any positive value - there is no bound on the right hand side.

"I ran 100 trials using the NYT interactive feature and it turns out math works. In each of the trials I elected to switch doors and it resulted in my winning the car 67% of the time. Conceptually, it helped to think about this problem by virtue of negation, i.e. in which of the possible scenarios would I NOT want to switch. The answer is one in three (the one in which I chose the car straight away), therefore, conversely, I would want to switch in two out of three scenarios.I had another way of approaching the problem in which I simply thought about choosing 'new' doors. In the first round of choosing, I had a 33% chance of choosing a new door with a car behind it and a 66% chance of choosing a new door with a goat behind it. Once a goat was revealed, I only had one 'new' door to select and my odds of selecting the car increased while my odds of selecting the goat decreased. Therefore, selecting a 'new' door (switching) would be advantageous. I wonder if there is a threshold at which this methodology would break down or gain strength. What if there were n doors and Monty revealed n-1 goats? n-2? n-n/2?",0,71,215,93.26,21.45,85.86,42.66,19.55,16.28,81.4,52.09,12.09,6.05,6.05,0,0,0,0,6.05,9.77,16.74,5.58,3.72,4.19,0.93,10.23,3.26,0,2.33,6.98,0.93,2.79,1.86,0.93,0,0,0,0.93,0,0,0,0,13.49,4.65,1.86,4.65,3.26,0,1.86,1.4,1.4,0,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,5.58,0.93,2.33,1.4,1.86,0.93,3.26,4.19,0.47,19.53,3.72,11.16,4.19,0.93,0,3.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.14,5.12,3.72,0,0,1.4,0,1.4,0,2.79,1.86,1.86

"So the information provided allows you to create a contingency (2x2) table. We are given percentages, so it is best to just make up a baseline number of patients of 100 (in order to fill out the table).If you make the top row \fracture\"" and the bottom row \""no fracture,\"" then you can fill out the row totals of 30 and 70. For the columns, you can make the left column >55 age and the right column =<55 age. Here \""marker\"" means an \""indicator\"" or something that identifies. So we use this as our \""test +\"" and \""test -\"" columns. This is the + or - marker for fraction!You are then told that 60% of the patients with a fracture are older than 55... So in the \""fracture\"" top row, 60% are >55. To solve for this, you take the row total = 30 and multiply it by .60 (for the 60%). This gives you 18. With a row total of 30 and the \""Fraction/>55\"" intersection of 18, you can solve for the \""Fraction/=<55\"" intersection.You are then told that 60% of the patients without a fraction are older than 55. You have the row total for \""no fraction\"" = 70 ... so (.60*70) = 21. Just like above, you can solve for the \""No Fraction/=<55\"" intersection.

I assume it meant that you should calculate if of 1000 blood samples that gather to form a bag of platelet what is the chance that at least one has HIV specimen in it. You calculate that none of 1000 samples contain HIV. According to 1 in <zipRedac>000 HIV+ that would be 2999 out of <zipRedac>000 probability of HIV negative for each sample. (2999/<zipRedac>0000) to the power of 1000 would be the probability that all the 1000 samples are HIV free. 1 minus this number (that is something like (0.<phoneRedac>66)^1000 (that equals to 0.<zipRedac>1649) would be 0.28<zipRedac>5 that is the probability that at least one specimen is contaminated with HIV ! (Although it is not equal to getting HIV from transfusion ! but whatever!) I guess this was the solution ! somebody correct me if wrong!P.S: I have another issue with the range of possible answers cause I used (0.9996)^1000 and I ended up with <zipRedac>2.9% which was not marked as correct ! If you use (0.999<zipRedac>)^1000 that would be 25.9% !

"I tried to work on a solution for the challenge. My knowledge on math beyond high school level is self-thaught, so I believe this is not the simplest way to do it. Anyway, here it goes:The expected average (E(x)) per lot will be:E(x)= (x+1)(1-Pn)+ (1)(Pn)x = number of pooled samplesPn = probability of negative resultGiven Pn = .9^xE(x)= (x+1)(1-.9^x)+ (1).9^xE(x)= x - x(.9^x)+1 -.9^x + .9^xE(x)= x - x(.9^x) + 1For n sample size, the total amount (Ta) of tests would be:Ta = E(x)* n/xTa = (x - x(.9^x) + 1) * (n/x)Ta = nx/x - nx.9^x/x +n/xTa = n - n(.9^x) + n/xThe difference (samples we would save), D(x), would be n - TaD(x) = n - (n - n(.9^x) + n/x)D(x) = n - n + n(.9^x) - n/xD(x) = n(.9^x) - n/xD(x) = n (.9^x - 1/x)The answer would be given by choosing our sample size n and maximizing this difference. So, for n = 100:D(x) = 100(.9^x - 1/x)We can see it by typing \max (100(.90^x - 1/x))\"" on wolfram alpha. http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=max+%<zipRedac>8100%<zipRedac>8.90%5Ex+-+1%<zipRedac>Fx%<zipRedac>9%<zipRedac>9It give us a local max when x = 3.75, aprox 4.Any thoughts on how to solve it in a different way?""",0,77,264,85.01,50,2.03,39.3,52.8,9.47,40.53,24.24,5.68,3.03,1.52,1.52,0,0,0,2.65,3.41,6.44,4.92,3.03,1.89,0.76,8.33,2.27,1.52,0.76,14.39,3.41,0.76,0.76,0,0,0,0,2.27,0,0,0,0,8.33,2.65,1.52,1.89,1.14,0.38,1.52,0.38,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.79,1.52,1.89,0.38,0,0,1.14,5.68,0.76,4.92,0.38,4.17,0.38,2.27,0.38,0,0,0,0,0.76,0,0.38,0,0,0.38,75,2.65,2.65,1.52,0,0.76,0,7.2,0.76,0,27.27,32.2
"Dear John,We recommend that you wait with rounding until the very last step. Every question will tell where to round to. If your result is 5.<zipRedac>11122233 and the question says round to the nearest whole number, you should put 6.0. If it says round to the nearest tenth and you get 28.434, you should enter 28.4. The key is rounding to what is requested in the question. I round 5.5 to 6.0, but only if you are asked to round to the nearest whole number. For the nearest tenth, 5.5 is correct. Hope this helps!Josh",1,44,99,78.09,97.8,12.65,80.64,12.38,13.13,83.84,49.49,12.12,8.08,1.01,1.01,6.06,0,0,4.04,8.08,12.12,8.08,3.03,7.07,0,18.18,9.09,4.04,2.02,10.1,3.03,3.03,3.03,0,0,0,0,18.18,0,1.01,0,0,13.13,3.03,1.01,6.06,7.07,2.02,4.04,7.07,5.05,2.02,5.05,0,0,0,0,0,5.05,3.03,0,1.01,1.01,0,1.01,13.13,2.02,12.12,3.03,6.06,3.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.16,8.08,5.05,0,0,0,1.01,0,0,0,0,2.02

"Great question! The \10% rule\"" is a rule of thumb that says that if the beta changes by more than 10%--in relative, not absolute terms--this is evidence of confounding. Keep in mind though that this is just a rule of thumb, so you also have to use your judgment.

I know this is a semantic problem, but my friend (e.g. my dumb little brother) won't let it go--he has it in his mind that if his first choice was the correct door, then choosing either of the losing doors by switching counts as two different outcomes and if we are counting outcomes we have two ways to win by switching (in these cases there is only one other door that can be offered), and two ways to lose (according to which of the two 'goat' doors Monty offers you).

"Hello Hany,I am always happy to help and I appreciate the kind words!Do you just mean left and right skew in general? Let me try explaining both of your questions with one example!As you may have seen in the lectures, a distribution is skewed if one tail is longer than the other (there is a lack of symmetry). With a right skew (also called positive), the bulk (or mass) of the data is on the left and there is a tail extending to the right with extreme values. (Go to google and look a pictures of right skewed data). Do you remember learning about odds ratios? You may remember that Dr. <redacted> mentioned that the sampling distribution of the OR is skewed to the right? If you think about how ORs are calculated and what they mean, it is clear that you cannot have negative values. (A negative OR does not make any sense!). With a limit at the lower end (zero is the limit since it cannot be negative), you get a skewed distribution. An OR can be any positive value from 0 to infinity. With large values on the right...you have right skewed data. So what can you do to ***Transform*** this data to deal with the fact that the distribution is skewed? What happens when you take the log of a negative number (try it on a calculator)?What happens when you take the log of a decimal <1 (for example try 0.5 on a calculator)?What happens when you take the log of 1? (try it on a calculator)?WHat happens when you take the log of 1000? (try it on a calculator)?When you transform data, you replace the variables by a function of the original variable. In many cases, this can change the shape of the distribution. Notice how the log of a large number is a lot smaller (for 1000 you get 6.91)? A logarithmic transformation reduces positive skewness by compressing the right end of the tail and extending the left/lower end. Why does this work?Try ln(1)-ln(.1) = on your calculator...Try ln(10) - ln(1) = on your calculator ...Try ln(1000) - ln(10) = on your calculator...What do you notice? The distance between all of these are the same when you use the log scale! So why use log transformations?Summary: the logarithm can move larger values closer together and smaller values farther apart...which can help with skewed distributions!best,Josh",1,95,418,83.74,76.35,37.81,78.39,19.9,15.79,78.71,52.15,11.48,6.22,0.72,0,5.26,0,0.24,5.26,11.96,12.44,8.13,4.31,5.98,1.67,16.27,5.74,2.87,4.31,4.07,1.67,3.83,3.35,0.48,0,0,0.48,7.18,0,0,0,0,13.4,2.87,2.15,0.72,5.26,1.67,2.87,1.2,0.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.89,0.96,2.87,2.39,2.39,0.24,1.67,14.83,0.48,13.4,0.96,9.57,2.87,0.72,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.12,6.46,1.91,0.24,0,3.35,1.2,0.72,0,0,8.13,3.11

"Hello Purav,So do you understand the difference between a parameter of a population and a statistics of a sample? When you take a sample n from N (population) you could get a sample that has a mean that is close to the true population mean. However, when you take a sample mean from a sample n, that mean will ALWAYS fall within the values of your sample. You will ALWAYS get a value that is within the range of values that you have sampled. You could have a sample/calculated sample mean and have a situation where the actual population mean falls outside of your sample data. So when you are calculating the sample variance and squaring distances from your SAMPLE mean, you are more likely to get a much lower estimate than the true variance from the actual population mean. This means you are likely to be underestimating the true population variance. Using n-1 provides a better estimate!When you divide by n-1 you divide by a smaller number than n. When you divide by smaller numbers, you get larger values, right? So you are less likely to underestimate!Best,Josh",1,46,195,81.87,95.93,22.21,91.94,19.5,15.38,80.51,50.77,12.31,9.23,0,0,9.23,0,0,3.08,12.31,11.28,8.21,5.13,6.15,0,16.92,11.28,5.64,3.08,1.03,7.69,5.13,4.62,0.51,0,0,0.51,10.26,0,0,0,0,12.82,5.13,0.51,1.03,1.54,2.56,2.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.67,0.51,1.03,2.56,4.1,0,0,14.87,1.03,10.26,1.03,5.64,3.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.79,3.59,3.59,0,0,1.03,1.03,1.03,0,0,1.03,0.51

"Hello!Great question!So technically, a CI does not mean that \there is 95% probability an interval contains the true mean.\"" A CI computed from a sample either does or does not contain the true mean. As the name implies, the CI is a measure of confidence that has to do with the way you calculated the interval - it is a reflection of the test. So, if you collect many samples and calculate the CI for each sample, in the long run, 95% of these will contain the true mean. Why is this the case? The population mean is a actually a constant - not a random variable. Since it does not change, the probability that this constant value falls within a certain range is either 0 or 1. [The range either includes the value or does not] Like I said, The CI is a measure of uncertainty that is associated with a sampling method. WHen you take different samples and compute an interval for each, some will include the true population value and others will not. Let me know if this helpsJosh""",1,94,183,80.83,22.21,62.75,98.1,20.33,19.13,87.98,55.74,8.74,2.73,1.09,0,1.64,0,0,6.01,16.39,8.2,10.38,4.37,6.56,3.28,15.85,8.74,3.28,1.09,2.19,6.56,6.56,6.01,0.55,0.55,0,0,4.37,0,0,0,0,22.4,4.37,2.19,1.09,6.56,3.28,9.29,0.55,0,0.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.73,1.09,0.55,0.55,1.64,0,0.55,14.21,1.64,9.29,1.64,3.83,3.83,2.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.85,4.37,4.37,0,0,0.55,1.09,1.09,1.09,0,0,3.28

"Hi guys,Is there any reason why a huge bulk of the homework was testing us on calculating Odds Ratios and their CI's and p values when this wasn't actually discussed for more than 2-3 slides in the lecture.

"Dear Dr. <redacted>, Josh and Classmates,               Have you seen the popular press (mags, TV, on line) announcements about running as little as 5 minutes a day leading to 45% less all cause mortality and 30% less cardiovascular (CVD) death, compared to nonrunners?  I found the study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and read if carefully. I did this because the headlines don't sound right to me. Also, I wanted to practice some of the skills we have been acquiring in this class.Definitely, this is an observational study so it is incorrect to say that running any amount of time is 'causing' the reductions in adverse outcomes, but the study authors themselves are using the 'as little as five minutes a day' line.This bothers me a lot. <zipRedac>) I don't think that the questionnaire asked people how many minutes they ran on a given day, but how much they ran in the past 3 months. 2) Most of the analysis compares all running groups to the non running groups and 3) multiple subgroup analysis are done.  I did not notice any alpha corrections for multiple tests.I also want to know 45 and 30% more than what number exactly (this may have been a healthy group of college educated white folks)?  I found two numbers in the text, Dr. <redacted>, otherwise most of the statistics are hazard ratios.  The numbers I found were 34<zipRedac>3 all cause deaths during the study period and <zipRedac>2<zipRedac>7 CVD deaths.  To find the number of events in each group, runners vs non, is it simply a multiplication problem?  Also, how can the authors assert that both the first quintile of running and the last quintile produced a 45% reduction?  Are they saying that because there is a lack of significant differences between the quintiles?  Is that appropriate?I really want to understand this study so that I can share the results in a responsible way - also, I love running.TY!    [Abstract][<zipRedac>]  [<zipRedac>]: http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleID=<zipRedac>89<zipRedac>600",0,73,350,81.17,46.57,30.86,41.25,25,24,80.29,44.57,9.71,5.43,3.71,0.29,0.29,0,1.14,4.29,9.43,10.86,6.86,4,7.43,0.86,14,4.86,3.71,1.14,5.14,6.57,3.14,2,1.14,0,0.29,0,5.71,0.29,0.57,0,0,14.29,2.86,3.71,1.71,2.29,1.71,2.57,1.71,0.57,0.86,0.29,0.86,0,0.57,0,0,4.86,2.29,1.43,0.29,0.29,1.14,4.57,8,0.29,10.57,2.86,4,3.71,6,2.29,0,0,0,1.14,0.57,0,0.57,0,0,0,25.43,4.57,4.29,0.29,0,2,0.29,0.29,0,1.71,2.57,9.43

"I think I would need more information about this example! While case-control studies are used to study rare outcomes (rare diseases), it seems unlike to study 4 mutually excluse rate outcomes at once. Depending how rare, how/when would a study be formulated so that there are enough cases with all 4 outcomes? About the recall bias - Recall bias can be a serious problem in retrospective studies (in particular case-control). In a case control study without recall bias, there would have be no difference in the tendency of cases to report events compared to the controls. Since cases (or those with a disease) are generally more likely to recall exposure related to diseases compared to controls, it is difficult to have no recall bias. However, if you do not use subjects to characterize exposures - - instead you use biologic markers (tests) related to exposures - - you might be able to minimize recall bias.

Hi! I've just watched the optional module for sample size formulas but I still have a doubt. For example: I have a scenario where I'm comparing two treatments and I want to use the hypothesis that they have the same effect (or that one is not different from the other). I want to calculate de sample size for this trial. I know the power I want (80% for example) and the significance level (0.05) but I don't have the effect size and the standard deviation yet. How do I calculate the sample size in this case?,0,47,96,50.33,4.8,55.79,12.09,16,15.62,79.17,56.25,16.67,11.46,10.42,0,0,0,1.04,5.21,11.46,8.33,9.38,5.21,7.29,2.08,15.62,3.12,3.12,2.08,4.17,3.12,1.04,0,1.04,1.04,0,0,2.08,0,0,0,0,17.71,3.12,4.17,3.12,4.17,0,6.25,1.04,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.12,1.04,0,1.04,0,1.04,1.04,14.58,0,5.21,0,3.12,2.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.71,4.17,0,1.04,0,1.04,1.04,0,0,3.12,6.25,1.04
"Basically, the authors found a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality and 45% reduction in heart disease mortality in runners vs. non-runners. This is not surprising. But then they broke runners into quintiles by different running characteristics (such as total time run, speed, and distance run). The Hazard Ratios appeared similar across the different quintiles of running activity. So, they concluded that running a little is just as good as running a lot. The headlines come from the fact that the lowest quintiles included people running <51 min per week (7 minutes per day), <6 miles , and 1 to 2 times per week. There are of course a lot of caveats! (1) When we break data into quintiles, the sample sizes in each quintile are much smaller than the sample size in the overall study. So chance may play a role. (2) People who run 51 minutes per week are probably not running 5-10 minutes per day; they are probably running 1-2 longer runs of several miles. If you are able to run several miles at once, you are probably reasonably fit and may have been running more than this at other times in your life. (3) People who run a small amount may be participating in many other physical activities; though the authors adjusted for this, it was a very crude adjustment. So residual confounding is likely. I think we can conclude that running and exercise is good for you. But it would be unreasonable to conclude that running slowly 5 minutes a day and doing nothing else will confer these benefits!",1,73,266,72.01,54.49,94.92,32.21,17.73,23.68,83.08,44.36,9.02,3.76,0.38,0.75,1.5,0,1.13,5.26,6.77,10.53,8.27,4.89,6.77,1.13,15.79,5.26,4.51,1.13,6.39,4.89,3.38,1.88,1.5,0,0,0.75,6.02,0,0,0,0,14.66,2.26,0.75,0.75,4.89,1.5,5.64,0.38,0.38,0,0,1.88,0.38,1.5,0,0,3.76,0.75,0.38,1.13,1.13,0.38,2.26,8.27,1.88,23.31,7.89,8.27,7.14,1.13,5.64,0,0,0,0.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.92,5.26,3.38,0,0.75,0,0.75,1.5,0,0,3.76,1.5

"Yeah, Josh, the same dumb mistake was made by me interpreting the wrong due time for the first hw, and in addition did not see the \quizzes\"" tab on top of the screen until after the first week was over and that is when I noticed a bunch of quizzes due by Sept 1.

The logistic regression model includes a number of other predictors. <br/>We are presented with a choice if patients who had cardiac surgery are more or less likely to die after discharge from the ICU than other patients. Thus we want to compare 2 groups.<br/>However, we do <b>not</b> have any other information about the 2 groups. It could be that they differ in other ways (in some of the other predictors in the logistic regression model) and, what I understand, the answer marked correct only holds if we can be sure that the 2 groups do not differ in any other way (does not differ much in any of the other predictors). The patients who had cardiac surgery may, for example, stay longer in the ICU, be older, have higher acute physiology points and higher chronic health points (or it may be the other way around, or maybe they do not differ from the other group). The question does not give us any of this information.<br/> Since the beta is adjusted for all this, we must really know if the 2 groups differ in any of these predictors before we can say anything about the <b>groups</b>. We can say something about two groups that do <b>not</b> differ in the other predictors, but we do not know if the 2 groups in the question differs.<br/><br/>Is the answer marked \correct\"" really the correct answer? To me it does not seem to be correct unless the question is reformulated, we get more data or we are allowed to use our \""clinical\"" knowledge (which not all taking the course have and it may even be distorted depending on the demographics around the hospital etc). We may guess and formulate a hypothesis that we may later test. But from the presented data, we just don't know.<br/>""",0,124,340,59.32,44.16,68.09,30.75,28.33,16.47,85.88,55.59,14.41,6.18,0.88,4.71,0,0,0.59,8.24,9.12,11.18,11.47,4.12,5,2.94,15.29,3.53,3.53,1.47,2.35,5.88,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,0,10.59,0,0,0,0,27.35,5,1.47,2.06,9.71,2.35,12.94,0.59,0,0.59,0,3.53,0,3.53,0,0,8.53,7.06,0,0.88,0.59,0,0.88,13.24,2.94,7.06,0.29,5.29,1.76,0.88,0,0.29,0,0,0.29,2.35,0,2.35,0,0,0,25.88,4.12,3.82,0,0,0.29,0,0,1.18,0.29,2.94,13.24

Perhaps it doesn't matter, though.

"I understand the point that a significant p-value can arise by chance if there is enough cumulative uncertainty. What if let's say someone else does the same testing on the same sample but does just that one test or less number of tests, and presumably comes out with the same result. We would discount the statistical significance in the setting of many other tests, but what about the same test done without the setting of many other tests? The \hallmarks of chance finding\"" slide was helpful but I'm unclear what exactly \""the pattern of effect size is inconsistent\"" means. Earlier Dr. <redacted> mentioned that in the study where they did 50 different tests, one thing that tipped us off that the significant p-values were due to chance was the small size of the effect and the fact that the effects were not consistently in the same direction. Are there any ways related to effect of the size and direction of the effect to assess whether a p-value that fails the multiple testing corrections is actually significant or is it always the case that if it fails the multiple-testing correction that p-value cannot be regarded as statistically significant?""",0,60,202,80.5,31.03,45.34,43.84,33.67,20.79,84.16,51.98,11.88,2.97,0.99,1.49,0,0,0.5,8.91,11.88,10.89,8.91,2.97,6.44,1.49,12.87,5.45,4.46,2.48,1.49,3.47,3.96,2.48,1.49,0.5,0,0.99,4.46,0,0,0,0,20.3,4.95,2.97,1.98,5.94,2.48,8.42,0.5,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.47,1.98,0.99,1.49,0,0.99,3.47,8.42,0,7.92,0.99,5.45,1.49,5.94,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.37,2.48,1.49,0,0,0.99,0,2.48,1.98,0.99,0,2.97

Therefore, we know that p>.05.As i understand from your following post that this value is significant because CI not containing 1?!!ONe of the Posts you mentiones the following:Hello Menlo Doc,Great questions!So it is good to start by thinking about what a null hypothesis actually is... It is a general starting statement/assumption that there is no relationship between two things measured. With risk ratios, you are taking the ratios of two risk. If our null is that there is no difference...what would the null value be?Null of a risk ratio = 1 means that there is no difference between the experiment and control group (equal risks!).If the null value = 1 falls within the CI calculated, then we FAIL TO REJECT the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is outside the CI, then our result is statistically significant (direction uncertain without more information).You are also correct that r = 0 is the null hypothesis for correlation coefficients. Null value for changes in mean? - - 0 [Makes sense right, no difference between two groups would be a difference of zero!]Odds ratio? - - What is the odds ratio [ratio of odds, so what would a null value be if we thought both groups were the same?

"Hello Cajpal,Q4. So yes the ORs are adjusted... this just means that there are other variables in the model that you have controlled for. When people/papers say adjusted OR this has nothing to do with being adjusted for multiple variables testing. Adjusting for age would mean including age in the model.

If our null is that there is no difference...what would the null value be?Null of a risk ratio = 1  This means that there is no difference between the experiment and control group (equal risks!).If the null value = 1 falls within the CI calculated, then we FAIL TO REJECT the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is outside the CI, then our result is statistically significant (direction uncertain without more information).r = 0 is the null hypothesis for correlation coefficients.Null value for changes in mean? - - 0 [Makes sense right, no difference between two groups would be a difference of zero!]Odds ratio? - - What is the odds ratio [ratio of odds, so what would a null value be if we thought both groups were the same?

"Glad you are enjoying the course! Every test you run increases the type of a chance I error, so technically you should correct for all p-values at the same time. However, bear in mind that you probably have a lot of overlap between the tests run with Cox regression and those run with logistic regression, for example. They may be so close to measuring the same thing that you are being conservative by adjusting p-values from both methods. So, I'd recommend that you narrow down the number of tests you are running by using clinical judgment. It's unlikely that you need to do both Cox regression and logistic. Pick one outcome that you care most about and focus on that. Also, given the high chance of false positives here, you might try to do some kind of validation.

"What?  Yes, Josh, I have watched it over and over again, she only did two calculations. She chose one of the pairs and then chose an extreme.  She had N = 7 and X=0 and then she did if X=7; in our case the N = 6 and we have a 5 and a 1, not a 7 and 0.  So our N=6 and I thought we could choose to do either x=5 or x=1 (the two discordant pairs); then I thought the extreme was either 6C6 or 6C0 which in my math is the same probability.  So I did 6C5*.5^5*.5^1 and added that probability to 6C6*.5^6*.5^0; for a p above .05 but less than the p values we get from an online calculator.  I think I have given substantial effort to trying to find the missing piece, but I just don't know what else to do.
